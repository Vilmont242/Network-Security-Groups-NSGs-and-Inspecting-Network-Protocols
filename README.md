<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machines, Wireshark, and Network Security Groups](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Use Wireshark to monitor network traffic involving Azure Virtual Machines as data moves through 
- Step 2:showing how to put up your guards,  Set up a basic experiment to explore the functioning of Network Security Groups (NSGs).
- Step 3: Analyze the effects of NSGs on network interactions in azure
- Step 4: Gain insights from the experiment to enhance Azure VM network security strategies.

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<p>
In this first step, You'll learn how to use Wireshark, a  tool that lets you observe data flowing to and from Azure Virtual Machines.

</p>
<p>
 In this step, we introduce you to Network Security Groups (NSGs), which act as virtual bouncers for your VMs. You'll learn how to configure NSGs to control incoming and outgoing traffic,

<p>
now we use practical experiments using NSGs to shape and manage network traffic, and we see how NSGs can be tailored to meet specific security and networking requirements
